# Emulation Station Theme - Penumbra V4
This theme is actually my fourth attempt at bringing together something that i like. I wanted to learn how to do the theming aspect of Emulationstation and got a little carried away.

This theme is a combination of some original artwork and some pieces that were picked apart from some other themes. Alos, this theme does support the use of video previews.

For best results use screenscraper.fr and pull the following:<br/>
**Visual Type** - Simple<br/>
**Default visual** - Screenshot<br/>
**Alt visual** - Wheel<br/>
**Marquee** - Wheel<br/>
**Video** - Yes<br/>
